# 857142
So this is a python program that shows that many numbers that end with 4 have a pattern when divided by 7, and, that pattern is '857142'. Meaning that when you divide 24 by 7, 857142 will show up somewhere in the result (of course 14 or 84 wouldn't work because they are exact divisions, and, every 70 numbers there'll be one that can be divided by 7).
